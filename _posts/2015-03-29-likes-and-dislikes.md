title: Likes and dislikes
---
> *I like, I don't like:* This is of no importance to anyone; this, apparently, has no meaning. And yet all this means: *my body is not the same as yours.* Hence, in this anarchic foam of tastes and distastes, a kind of listless blur, gradually appears the figure of a bodily enigma, requiring complicity or irritation. Here begins the intimidation of the body, which obliges others to endure me *liberally*, to remain silent or polite confronted by pleasures or rejections which they do not share.  
— Roland Barthes, *Roland Barthes*

I've always loved this passage (preceded by a list of Barthes' own likes and dislikes) in which Barthes seems to grasp a disavowed violence at the heart of sentiments like "à chacun son goût".

But what about the way we confront **our own** likes and dislikes? Barthes seems to have arrived at a serene acceptance of the "anarchic foam" of his own tastes, an arbritrariness that's no more motivated than a fingerprint, or whose motivations are so buried that there's no point interrogating them.

I, on the other hand (is it just me?), find myself constantly searching for a set of "rules" that will explain why I like some things and dislike others — explain to myself as much as to others. When I come across something that seems to go against the rules (love Wagner, can't stand Bruckner, etc.), there's a part of me that won't be satisfied until I either modify my tastes or find a hidden logic by which the superficial disparity masks a deeper consistency.

The psychic compromise I end up making is on settling on rules that are so vague that they can be used to justify anything at all: "My favourite quality in music is **intensity**" is my latest.
